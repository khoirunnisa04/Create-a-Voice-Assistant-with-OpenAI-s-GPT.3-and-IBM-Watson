Create your own voice assistant using OpenAI's advanced language processing technology and IBM Watson Embeddable AI. 
Your assistant will be able to understand and respond to your questions and requests in real time, using voice utilizing text-to-speech and speech-to-text capabilities. 
By the end of the guided project, you'll have a fully functional AI-powered voice assistant to help you with whatever questions you have, anytime, anywhere.

Voice AI could be the next big thing when you look at the stats. Analysts expect 90% of all new vehicles will include voice assistants. 
Over 75 billion connected devices will be operating globally by 2025, and voice AI can be used to control them. It's expected that 94% of large corporations will use Voice AI in the near future. 

In this guided project, you'll learn how to build your own AI assistant using OpenAI's pre-trained GPT-3 model. 
Unlike the popular ChatGPT which communicates with text, your personal assistant will use voice. 
You will use Watson Speech-to-Text to give your AI assistant the gift of hearing and Watson Text-to-Speech so that your assistant can read the answers back to you.

With a voice-based personal assistant at your beck and call, you'll be able to get answers, find information, and even have conversations, all without lifting a finger.
